# Report by Add Team Member Names

## Project Summary

TODO: Describe the completed project. Provide motivation for your project, application that your robot is utilized for, specific goals/tasks it completes, and include any background references you used to develop the idea for your project (links are okay).

## Project Implementation Details

TODO: First, outline all steps one must take to run your project, including any needed installations. Then describe **all** steps you took to implement the task, including all non-technical and technical details. Please include references (links are okay) to all resources you have used.

## Experimental Results

TODO: Conduct at least three experiments with your completed implementation, where something is varied in each experiment (for example changes in the environment). Produce visual representation of these experiments (pictures or videos). Describe your observations of the outcome of these experiments (how did the robot behave in these experiments? were there variations?).

## Ethical Implications

Based on your experiences with the project and from our discussions in class, please provide answers for the following questions as related to the project you chose to implement:

1. Who would typically make the technology of the similar type as your project? Why?

TODO: Add an answer to the question above.

1. Who are the intended users of this robotic application? How does this technology benefit them?

TODO: Add an answer to the question above.

1. Who is not supposed to use this technology? Why?

TODO: Add an answer to the question above.

1. How can the type of robotic application implemented in your project cause harm?

TODO: Add an answer to the question above.

1. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by this type of technology or to fix the harm?

TODO: Add an answer to the question above.

## Team Working Strategy

TODO: Describe the details of your team working strategy, specifically explain how did you complete this work as a team and describe the specific contributions of each team member.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences
