# Report by Katie Burgess, Pallas Cain, Danny Ulrich

## Project Summary

TODO: Describe the completed project. Provide motivation for your project, application that your robot is utilized for, specific goals/tasks it completes, and include any background references you used to develop the idea for your project (links are okay).

Our project is a simulation of the arm manipulators used in the manufacturing field. The arm is meant to move pieces from the start zone to the machine and then to the finished zone. Our concept came from Katie and Pallas's experiences working at Acutec.

## Project Implementation Details

TODO: First, outline all steps one must take to run your project, including any needed installations. Then describe **all** steps you took to implement the task, including all non-technical and technical details. Please include references (links are okay) to all resources you have used.

## Experimental Results

TODO: Conduct at least three experiments with your completed implementation, where something is varied in each experiment (for example changes in the environment). Produce visual representation of these experiments (pictures or videos). Describe your observations of the outcome of these experiments (how did the robot behave in these experiments? were there variations?).

Different materials impact?

## Ethical Implications

Based on your experiences with the project and from our discussions in class, please provide answers for the following questions as related to the project you chose to implement:

1. Who would typically make the technology of the similar type as your project? Why?

Our robot simulates a process very similar to automated manufacturing. Robotic arms and manipulators like our project are used by large manufacturing companies to speed up the process and make it more consistent overall.

1. Who are the intended users of this robotic application? How does this technology benefit them?

TODO: Add an answer to the question above.

1. Who is not supposed to use this technology? Why?

TODO: Add an answer to the question above.

1. How can the type of robotic application implemented in your project cause harm?

One argument that people use against having automated robots in manufacturing is that the robots take people's jobs or that people are getting replaced by robots in manufacturing. Another possible harm is the environmental impact of manufacturing process.

1. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by this type of technology or to fix the harm?

Manufacturing businesses using robotics are often still desperate for people to hire. Additionally, robotics creates more high paying jobs because people have to run the robots too. The environmental impact of the manufacturing field could be counteracted with being more environmental conscious and creating programs to counteract the emissions put out by the plants.

## Team Working Strategy

Our teamworking strategy was to have at least two people testing at the same time while one person worked on the report. Katie worked a lot with coding the robots movements. Danny and Pallas helped to make the resin cubes. Pallas and Katie designed the board for the robot to sit on. We all worked on the hardware of the arm trying to fix the first robot. We all were also a part of the testing process discussing what changes needed to be made and putting the blocks back in order. Additionally, we all worked on the report.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

The biggest challenge we faced during this assignment was finding a working arm. The first arm we started with was put on backwards and the motor was not working as well as we wanted so we had to switch robots. This meant we had to rewrite our code for the new robot. It was very frustrating but we overcame this with a lot of patience. One of the biggest learning takeaways was that we spent a lot of time considering the design of the robot and how it would interact with the environment. We learned the arm could only stretch so far and only rotate so many degrees. This meant we had to work within the confines of the arm's capabilities. Another learning takeaway was how much testing is involved with robotics. This project definitely took the most testing of all the projects we did this past semester. Every small edit in the positioning needed to be tested to make sure the arm could still pick up the blocks. All this testing took a lot of patience and critical thinking.
