# Project Proposal by Katie Burgess, Pallas Cain, Danny Ulrich

## Proposed Project Idea

For our final project we are planning on using the evo arm to simulate automated machining. We are focusing on this because Pallas and Katie both have a background in manufacturing and find it interesting. We are planning on writing our program in python. Our background we used to develop the idea was our real-life personal experiences with manufacturing and the automation of it.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Writing the program in Python
- Correctly placing the item in all locations
- Assuring correctly-working hardware (to the best of our abilities)
- Having this program run for multiple 'parts'
- Picking up and placing the items in grid-patterned starting and ending locations.

## Feasibility

This is a feasible idea, as it is something that Katie has experience in the past through her internship, a well as it is something we are building upon from one of the second-round evoarm groups. One of the groups moved blocks sideways, so we are expanding on this idea for doing it for more parts, adding realism, and having more placing and pick up locations per part.

## Additional Hardware

We need:

- 'parts' to pick up
- platforms to place the pieces in, to act like the machines
- possibly a new arm motor to use if it is broken
