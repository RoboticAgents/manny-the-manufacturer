# Project Proposal by Add Team Member Names

## Proposed Project Idea

TODO: Clearly describe your idea for a final project, including what robot you plan to use, what application you focusing on and why, and include any background references you used to develop the idea for your project (links are okay).

## Acceptance Criteria

In a bulleted list, include predefined requirements that must be met for your project to be considered complete. You must identify at least five requirements for your robotic system to satisfy the goals of the project you are setting. These requirements must be specific, easily verifiable, and be an important part of the project's success. For example, for a robot delivery system, some of the requirements might include building correct map of a specific environment, correctly delivering items to the location, and correctly returning to its base location.

## Feasibility

TODO: Explain why is your proposed idea feasible. For example, are you extending a previous project or have a sample code from someone else's project to start with?

## Additional Hardware

TODO: If your project requires additional hardware, please list it below and include a link to a website where it can be purchased. If you need resources other than hardware, please list them as well. If you do not require any additional resources, just state that fact.
