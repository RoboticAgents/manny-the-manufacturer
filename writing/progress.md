# Progress Report by  Katie Burgess, Pallas Cain, Danny Ulrich

## Completed Prototype

Our robot can currently pick up one of the resin cubes and place it in the correct spots in the correct sequential order. First it grabs onto the first cube from the starting area and picks it up then it moves it to the middle where our "machining process" would hypothetically be located and places it down. Then the arm picks the block back up and places it in the second area or the "finished" pile. It places it in the first blocks specific location, in the real world this would cycle between the four locations before looping back to the first or would just be a single location on a conveyer belt for instance.

## Remaining Work

The main goal our group has for the future is to be more accurate with where the robot is picking up and placing the blocks. We have to test to find exactly the x and y placement values are for the rest of the blocks. This also includes completing the code for moving the remaining three blocks through the central "machine" position and to their final position on the finished side. We also still need to complete the report for our project. Additionally, we would like to have a more professional looking place setting for our demonstration to take place on.
